	I started recreational reading in late 2019 and found it really challenging. It was, and still is, really challenging to follow an author from the beginning of a book to the end and then to reflect on what was discussed once I get there. It turns out that reading, like any other skill, needs to be done consistently.

<p1>
	Recently I came across book reviews written by <a href="https://sive.rs/book">Derek Sivers</a> and <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/notes">Nate Liason</a>, as well as this video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjoxkxM_I5g">"How I Remember Everything I Read"</a>) created by Ali Abdaal which discusses more active forms of reading, all of which encouraged me to start writing my own reports and to post them here.
</p1>>

<p1>
	These reports are written following a template created by <a href="https://www.notion.so/3a7b2ebfeef24386928cf1b410e1ad3f?v=54a24698aff543abbeb35de80ee8b354">Ali Abdaal</a> and are long, disorganized and opinionated - they are really more thoughts than they are anything else.
